            <h3>Movember Foundation</h3>
            <p> For all of you that have not heard of the Movember Foundation, you may have heard of ‘No Shave November’.  If neither ring bell, this foundation challenges men to grow moustaches during Movember (formerly known as November), to spark conversation and raise vital funds for its men’s health programs. We like to look out for our fellow Mo Bro’s and Mo Sista’s. The Bro’s grow out our stashes, and go around with pamphlet and information through the month of November informing people on healthy habits for men and how to prevent diseases such as testicular cancer, prostate cancer, and other common men’s health issues. At the end of this month we come together at our annual Gala Dinner for good food, great music, and awesome stashes just to have a grand ol’time spreading awareness.       </p>

            <h3>Elk's Camp Moore</h3>
            <p>Camp Moore is a camp located in the hills of Ramapo that offers fun filled vacation from home for children with special needs. We like to ensure that the program is successful and provide each child with a great camping experience. As a brotherhood, we go around with information through the month of April, informing people on remarkable experiences that the camp offers. During the month, we come together at our Spaghetti Dinner to stress the importance of the camp and explain how Elks Camp Moore is an outstanding experience for each individual camper.    </p>
